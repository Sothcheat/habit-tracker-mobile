/**
 * Writes that failed because the network was unreachable, kept until it comes
 * back.
 *
 * Every mutation is queued, and each obeys the same three rules:
 *
 * - each carries **its own date or timestamp**, resolved when the user acted,
 *   so a tap made last night is not filed under today when it finally sends;
 * - each is **idempotent**, so a reply lost in a dying connection costs a
 *   duplicate at worst (rows bring their own id and collide on replay, a
 *   daily upserts on `(task_id, log_date)`, a delete that finds nothing has
 *   already happened);
 * - each **names rows by an id that already exists on this device**. A task
 *   created offline is given its uuid here rather than by the database, so a
 *   tap, an edit or a delete queued behind it names the row the insert will
 *   create. Replaying in order is then enough — nothing has to be rewritten
 *   when the insert finally lands.
 *
 * Entries are **data, not closures.** A closure cannot be written to storage,
 * so a reload — likely on a phone, which is where offline happens — would drop
 * every pending write without a trace. Data survives, and can be counted for
 * the user, collapsed, and inspected in devtools.

 * - **Deleting cancels everything queued about that task**, and if the task
 *   was itself created offline the delete is not queued either: the server
